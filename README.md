**MacOS Mojave RSS Screensaver**<br>
I had recieved a personal request from a certain friend, to come up with a fix for the broken rss screensaver. After much googling and StackOverflow Browsing I was equipped with the tools to parse rss like a boss! I paired that up with my already existing xp on sceensaver building, and voila: RSSNut!

The following rss screensaver solutions have been broken in Mojave:<br>
• [Broken solution from gadgethacks](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/get-apples-rss-visualizer-back-as-screensaver-mac-os-x-10-8-higher-0156457/)<br>
• [Broken solution from cultofmac](https://www.cultofmac.com/183566/restore-apples-rss-visualizer-screensaver-to-mountain-lion-os-x-tips/)<br>
• [Broken solution from macworld](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120801171948345)<br>


This screensaver is meant to replace the above broken solutions.

## Installation:
1) Download the screensaver [here](https://github.com/Samuel-IH/RSSNut/releases/latest)
2) Extract the screensaver from the zip and open it. To open it you may have to control-click it and then click "open" to get past security settings. System Preferences will now install it.
3) Select the screensaver in System Preferences and customize to your liking, You can change the read speed, theme color, and of course, the rss feed.

"Title Flash" will set the read speed to extremely fast, just long enough that you can see the title and maybe a little bit more before the next feed is displayed.

## Two Cool Features:
When viewing a post that you would like to read more of, type "l" as in "link", to view it in your browser.

To skip a boring post, type "n".
